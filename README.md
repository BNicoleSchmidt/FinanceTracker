CoderGirl Java Team Project: Finance Tracker

This is an application for roommates tracking finances together.  It's also
a learning experience for team project work for apprentice developers within
CoderGirl St. Louis.

The application tracks transactions (both debits and credits) by
what the item is, the amount, the category, and which roommate it came from.
The application also provides basic reporting.
